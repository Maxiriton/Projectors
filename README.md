# Projector Add-on for Blender
Simple projector creation and modification for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## What this Add-on can do for you
* easy creation and modification of physically based projectors
* real world projector settings like **throw ratio**, **resolution** and **lens shift**
* project test textures or your own content like images and videos
* preview the projections in Cycles render mode (Eevee will be supported when the needed functionality is implemented)  

## Note
* works only with Blender 2.8

## Installation
* Download the repo by clicking "Clone or download" and then download as ZIP (don't unpack the file on your computer).
* Open Blender 2.8.
* Go to the User Preferences in the Addon tab.
* Click Install from File and choose the zip file you downloaded.
* Activate the add-on by clicking on the checkbox.

## Missing something?
I'm interested and open for suggestions. Let me know how you use the add-on and how it could improve. Open a issue or message me.

P.S. Germans like to call a projector, a beamer.
